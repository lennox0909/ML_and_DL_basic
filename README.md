**Figure Legend and Description**

## Scenario (depend on kind of data)
* Supervised Learning
* Semi-Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Reinforcement Learning
* Transfer Learning

## Task (depend on kind of question to be adressed)
* Regression
* Classification
* Structured (structured input/output)
  * Speech Recognition (Voice to Sentense)
  * Translation (Chinese to English)
  * etc.

## Method (mathematic algorithm)
* Linear Model
* Non-Linear Model
  * Deep Learning
  * SVM
  * Decision Tree
  * K-NN
  * etc.

## Talk a little bit more on Learnings
### Supervised Learning
**Input/Output as a pair, require labor labeling**
* Regression: function output as a scala
* Classification:
  * Binary: Yes or No
  * Multi-calss: class 1, 2 ,3 ...etc.

### Semi-Supervised Learning
**Little amount of labeled data, with huge amount of unlabeled data**

### Unsupervised Learning
**Unlabeled data**
* Cluster
* Machine Drawing (GAN)
* etc.

### Reinforcement Learning
**Unlabeled data, mostly from the environment in realtime**

## Supervised vs Reinforcement
* Supervised: Learn from teacher (label)
* Reinforcement: Learn from score feedbacked from environment
